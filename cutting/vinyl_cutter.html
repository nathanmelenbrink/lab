  #### To print from an image in Inkscape:
  - Open a new document in Inkscape. The document should be 22.99 inches in width and 62.99 inches in height. This is the default document size.
  - On the top menu bar, click 'File', then click 'Import'. Import a black and white image into Inkscape.
  - Move image to the bottom left corner. The bottom left corner is the origin.
  - On the top menu bar, click 'Path', then click 'Trace Bitmap'.
  - Select your image if it isn't already selected. It should show up in the preview box in the Trace Bitmap menu.
  - For black and white images, the Brightness cutoff detection mode works. Click apply at the bottom of the menu.
  - This creates a new Bitmap image over your original image. Move this new image out of the way, and delete the old image. Then place your new image in the bottom left corner.
  - The new image only has the 'Fill' property. We need to add a 'Stroke' property. While holding down the Shift key, click on any color in the color bar to add a 'Stroke' to the image.
  - Next, double click on the color next to the word 'Stroke' in the bottom left corner. This will pull up the Fill and Stroke menu to the right of the screen. 
  - Click on stroke style. 
  - Change the Stroke width to 0.5 px (IMPORTANT, will not cut if the stroke width is incorrect).
  - Now print the image by clicking Ctrl+P or 'File->Print'.
  - The Roland GX-24 should be the selected printer.
  - Send file to vinyl cutter by pressing Print.
