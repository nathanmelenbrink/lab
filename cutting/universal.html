### Universal PLS6.150D in SC 103

### Standard Operating Procedure

_Please do not use the laser cutter until youâ€™ve been trained with lab staff. 
Read the [manual](./PLS.pdf) to learn more about ULS laser cutters._  


1. Turn on the exhaust (switch on the wall)
  - It will take 1-2 min for fan to get up to speed and power interlock to engage
  - The air compressor will turn on automatically. 

2. Turn on the laser cutter 
  - Switch is on right side

3. Do all the normal checks before cutting/engraving
  - Home XY
  - Check focus (adjust Z as needed)
  - Check for debris in nozzle at output lens
  - Check SETTINGS in ULS control software before printing!

4. Turn of the laser cutter and the exhaust when finished 


### File Preparation 

From Rhino (preferred): 

1. Open ULS Template.3dm. This file contains all of the settings needed to cut or score. 
2. File -> Import your DXF, SVG or other CAD file. Check scale relative to the laser bed outline. 
3. Move your vectors to the appropriate layer (cut, score, engrave). 
4. Print to ULS 


From Inkscape or Fusion 360: 

1. Create drawing
2. Save as .pdf  
3. Open with Adobe Reader 
4. Print to ULS from Adobe Reader


### Safety issues

- Always keep within the tape on the floor in front of laser while cutting. Watch during the entire cut.
- Wait a few minutes after cutting plastics before opening the laser cutter to allow for outgassing.   
- If a fire occurs, hit the emergency stop, turn off exhaust fan and wait for fire to subside.
- If it does not subside, use your judgement to fight fire with fire blanket or [extinguisher](https://www.osha.gov/etools/evacuation-plans-procedures/emergency-standards/portable-extinguishers/use).
- When fire is beyond safe control, call operations on the red phone to report fire. Pull fire alarm. Exit building.


### Materials 

- Pretty much anything in the ULS materials database is okay. 
- Most anything plant-derived: cardboard, wood, leather, fiber...
- Some plastics: Acrylic (plexiglass), Delrin
- Never cut: PVC plastic, ABS plastic. Ask if in doubt about a material.
