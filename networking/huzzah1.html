<h3> Simple WiFi Server </h3>

<p> Once you have drivers and boards installed, navigate to File &gt; Examples &gt; Examples for ESP32 &gt; WiFi &gt; SimpleWifiServer. We'll work with this code, but first we need to make some changes. </p>

<p>The following lines demonstrate standard usage of the WiFi library (including the library, then creating a WiFiServer instance called server on port 80). </p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include &lt;WiFi.h&gt;

WiFiServer server(80);
</code></pre>

<p> Next, replace the following lines with your wifi SSID and password.</p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
const char* ssid     = "yourssid";
const char* password = "yourpasswd";
</code></pre>


<p> Finally, connect an LED to pin 5 of the ESP32. Upload the code and open your Serial monitor. If nothing shows up in your Serial monitor, press the reset button on the ESP32. </p>


<p> Copy the IP address from your Serial monitor and paste it in your web browser. It should look like this: </p>

<img src='./browser.png' alt='browser'>

<p> The ESP32 is now acting as a web server on your local network. Clicking the links on the webpage create different GET requests, which pass different instructions to the ESP32 server. Try logging in with other devices on your network. Pay attention to the serial monitor; it will let you know when new clients connect to your server. </p>

<p> If you want to stream data to your browser without the overhead of HTTP GET requests, you'd have to use Websockets. <a href='https://esp8266-shop.com/blog/websocket-connection-between-esp8266-and-node-js-server/'>Node JS</a> is a great way to do that. </p>

<p> While this technique will work fine for controlling devices from within your home or other local network, the contents of your local server are not accessible to the world wide web. In other words, you won't be able to talk to your devices from outside of your LAN. There are a couple ways to get around that, which we'll discuss in the <a href='./huzzah1b.html'>next step.</a></p>
