### Stepper Motor Control with L9110

<p> Note: These products can get hot enough to burn you long before the chip overheats. Take care when handling this product and other components connected to it. </p>

<h3>Stepper Motor </h3>

<p> We have a number of different bipolar stepper motors in the lab.
Find motors around the lab and look up their data sheets, especially rated current/phase, voltage, and phase resistance (e.g. US-17HS441, 17HS19-2004S1, etc.). Let's use the following motor for this example: 
<a href='https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/nema-17-bipolar-1-8deg-26ncm-36-8oz-in-0-4a-12v-42x42x34mm-4-wires.html?search=Nema%2017%20Bipolar%201.8deg%2026Ncm%20%2836.8oz.in%29%200.4A%2012V%2042x42x34mm%204%20Wires'>Nema 17 Bipolar 1.8deg 26Ncm (36.8oz.in) 0.4A 12V 42x42x34mm 4 Wires</a>. </p>

Note some of the Electrical Specifications: 

- Rated Current/phase: 0.4A 
- Voltage: 12V
- Phase Resistance: 30ohms


<h3>Current Limiting </h3>
<p> Our motors have a maximum current rating of 0.4A with a 30Î© coil resistance, which would indicate a maximum motor supply of 12V. Using such a motor with a higher voltage would allow higher step rates, but the current must actively be limited to under 0.4A. (Anyway, we won't be using more than 9V). 
</p>

<h3> Wiring</h3>

<br> <br>

Above, the Arduino, with motor leads on pins 8,9,10, and 11 (green, yellow, orange, brown). Note that short yellow solid-core wires are used to connect female pins to sockets on the colored wires. The board is plugged into a 9V power supply (lower left side of board.) The red wire is plugged into Vin, which sends the 9V directly to the motor driver module. If you need more than ~1A, you'll need to connect the power supply directly to the motor driver module, not through the Vin pin. In that case, power the Arduino separately. Black wire goes to ground.

The same six wires plug into the module as shown in the picture below: Red and black in the middle and the four leads from the digital out pins go to the two sides.

On the output side of the module the green/black and blue/red wires from the stepper are plugged into the two outputs, using the solid-core short yellow wires.

<h3> Programming </h3>
<p> At the most basic level, we can control the chopper driver simply by sending pulses to the STEP pin of the driver. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
const int stepPin = 13;
const int dirPin = 12;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
  delay(50);
  digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
  delay(50);
}
</code></pre>

<p> Switching the DIR pin from LOW to HIGH will reverse the direction of the motor. </p>

<p> We can choose a library to help simplify control of stepper motors. The <a href='https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/stepper'>Arduino Stepper Motor Library</a> supports differnt driver configurations. The <a href='https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/index.html'>AccelStepper</a> library extends this functionality with acceleration/deceleration and non-blocking (no delay()) functions.   </p>


<pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include &lt;AccelStepper.h&gt;

const int stepPin = 13;  // blue
const int dirPin = 12;   // orange

// Define a stepper and the pins it will use
AccelStepper stepper(1, stepPin, dirPin); // initialise accelstepper for a two wire board

void setup()
{
}

void loop()
{
  if (stepper.distanceToGo() == 0)
  {
    // Random change to speed, position and acceleration
    // Make sure we dont get 0 speed or accelerations
    delay(1000);
    stepper.moveTo(rand() % 1000);
    stepper.setMaxSpeed((rand() % 1000) + 1);
    stepper.setAcceleration((rand() % 1000) + 1);
  }
  stepper.run();
}
</code></pre>
