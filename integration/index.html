### Project Integration: 

- Powering (wall plug, LiPo, USB battery)
- Wires (heat shrink, ribbon cables, screw terminals)
- PCB (1 or 2-sided, stacking headers)
- Mechanical (heat set inserts, captive nut)
- Enclosures 

### Powering Projects 

- Projects that need to be portable should use a battery, but otherwise projects should be powered by a wall adapter. 
- LiPo batteries are popular, but require more [attention to safety](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/blog/lipo-battery-safety-101-a-guide). LiPo batteries come in cells (increments of 3.7 V). Typically, we'll support using single-cell LiPos for, e.g., wearable projects, but discourage multi-cell LiPos (which are commonly used for drones or RC cars, require specialized chargers, and are generally less safe). 
- Coin cells 
- AA or AAA battery packs 
- USB battery packs 
- Bench Power Supplies 
- [Wind](https://mehmetguvenilir.github.io/PHYS_S-12/final.html), solar, other
